The BRAIN GAMES are a set of five CHALLENGING games built to test your intellect. Are you smart? After three correct answers, you will find out! Incorrect results end and exit the game. 

The games are:

- 😅 **Even number**. Is the number even or not? Only you can answer!
- 🤑 **Calculator**. Calculate the result of an arithmetic expression (addition, subtraction, multiplication).
- 🍆 **Greatest common divisor**. Probably the hardest game. Find the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
- 🗿 **Progression**. Search for a missing number in the range.
- 😂 **Prime numbers**. Determine if the number below is prime or not.
